The purpose of this class is to make an applet double buffered, have a frame rate, and proper focus
	Double Buffering, frame rate, and focus are each different and independent of each other!
	instead of extending Applet, extending MyApplet will make all of the above true
	you can reset the frame rate and many other things by using the accessor methods provided
NOTE: do not use the repaint method, or override the start, 
	run, stop, or update methods in your subclass!!!!!
